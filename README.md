# Arduino, Ruby &amp; Sinatra - The Internet Of Things's Rat Pack

Frank, Sammy &amp; Dean were a great team known as the "Rat Pack". What's true for these fellows is also true for Sinatra, Ruby and Arduino: put them together for instant awesomeness!

If you connect the strengths of these three mates, you're able to turn household objects into social objects. Examples range from the amazing talkative ping pong table a.k.a. [Occupy Ping Pong!](https://github.com/makersandco/Occupy-Ping-Pong) Makers & Co. did in cooperation with an Advertising School, over the digital foosball table I prototyped for an agency last year to the [Empathic Servo](https://vimeo.com/27113323) which uses Ruby logic to translate between a face recognition software, the serial port and a servo motor.

To put it short: the Internet of Things is rising and although being a hardware centric concept it still needs some middleware <3 to negotiate. That's where Arduino (Dean), Sinatra (Frank) and Ruby (Sammy) get together for rapid prototyping and instant awesomeness!
